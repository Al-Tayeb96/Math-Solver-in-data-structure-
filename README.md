# Math-Solver-in-data-structure-
In	 this	 project,	 you	 will	 implement an	 expression	 tree	 to	 evaluate	 given	
binary	 arithmetic	 expressions. Your	 program	 must	 read	 expressions	 from	 a	
file containing a	single	equation	on	each	line. The	equations	are	written	as	infix	
expressions. For	 each	 line	 the	 program	 should	 print	 the	 value	 resulting	 from	
evaluating	 the	 expression. Your	 program	 should	 support	 the	 following	
operations:	+	- *	/	%	(	).	White	spaces	or	special	characters	are	ignored.
Example	input:
3+5*(10-2)
1+1+1+1*8
100/3/2
100%3
In	this	case,	the	output	should	contain	the	following:
43
11
16
1
You	should	use	an	array	implementation	of	your	Stack	library	that	you	will	
use	in	this	work.
Your	application	should	be	able	to	show	the	following	information	through	
a	proper	menu	of	the	application:
1. Read	equations
2. Print	equations
3. Evaluate	using	Expression	tree
4. Print	postfix	expressions
5. Save	to	output	file (postfix	and	results)
6. Exit
